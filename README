UPDATED GOAL:
MVC Javascript on both server running Node and client. The same code is run in 
both, the framework works out what to do with it.
NOTE: Only the client is finished.

The framework is tiny. core is 3k minified, 1.2k gzipped. 
I need to document it somewhat.

ORIGINAL GOAL:
This is a project that has grown out of my day to day work to create a 
lightweight, jquery compatible MVC framework for creating a Javascript front
end application. 
It will be simple to use and encourage jQuery and Javascript best practice as 
well as CSS namespacing.
It will never be complete, there's always more and better ways of doing things 
than will be encapsulated here, so my aim is for a stable WIP.
I'm currently building the library, so don't try and use it until there are 
samples in the examples directory :)

CHANGELOG:
23-Mar-12
=========
Added build tools. build-all/core/jquery requires node and builds the output into 
the compiled directory.
Build core currently builds jquery core as the lib for now requires it. I shall 
write code shortly that removes this dependency.
Fixed tests.
Wrote more tests.

22-Mar-12
=========
I worked out a while back that there was already a JSMVC, so renamed the thing in 
my mind. Refactored for rename.

21-Mar-12:
=========
Finally got JsTestDriver running properly, added tests for a lot of things and 
refactored some other stuff.
Worked on the helloworld example.

8-Oct-11:
=========
Added jsmvc.js and moved core methods into it. Wrote includes method. Added 
jsmvc-test.html. No tests yet, coming soon.
Reformatted objects to better show API methods.
Added FF namespace.
Rewrote FF.Console.log
